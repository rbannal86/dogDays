# dogDays

## Overview

Borrowing inspiration from the mood tracking app trend, dogDays in a dog "mood" tracking app that aims to visualize the interactions
between owner and dog through activities such as walking and training, while taking a simple gauge of how that activity went. Based on
the aggregate scores of those activities for each day, a calendar view is then shown with different colors for each day based on that aggregate.

## Features

### Sample Account and User Guide

A comprehensive user guide with pictures goes over all of the features in the app. A sample account exists for anyone to take a look at all of the features dogDays provides.

### Register and Log In

Simple register and log in forms that utilize Firebase and its user authentication tools.

### Dashboard

A dashboard that displays all of the relevant data, from user name to today's date. A button bar allows a user to view details for the selected dog, edit those details, view activities for a selected day, add a new dog, select a new dog, and navigate to the user guide.

### Calendar

The calendar shows either a week, month, or year based on the user's selection. Any day with an activity logged will display a color based on the aggregate level of all activities. From darker to lighter, each view shows how things have been going with your dog.
